    - name: JavaScript
      description: |-
          The language I use the most. I have been using it for both front end and back end.
                  It is one of the languages I am most proficient in. I feel at ease doing almost anything with it.
      level: 5
    - name: TypeScript
      description: |-
          When using JavaScript, if possible, I always go through TypeScript first and then
                  transpile it. I have been using it for both front end and back end.
      level: 5
    - name: Dart
      description: |-
          At first when I saw that Flutter used Dart, an obscure language, I did not understand why.
                  After using it however, I quickly understood why and started loving. Its powerful syntax allow me
                  to code safely and efficiently. I love it.
      level: 5
    - name: Kotlin
      description: |-
          When starting a new Android native project, I will always choose Kotlin over Java.
                  The language manages to offer null safety and productivity.
      level: 3
    - name: Swift
      description: |-
          I have already developed native plugins for Flutter. Native plugins require native code.
                  I have also fiddled with SwiftUI. It was very easy to pick up, as it reminds Flutter a lot.
      level: 2
    - name: Java
      description:
          I mainly used it for Android development, but I also worked on back-end
          projects featuring Spring Boot.
      level: 3
    - name: C#
      description:
          I mostly used C# coupled with Unity, but I also developed Windows applications
          with it. MonoEngine is also familiar.
      level: 2
    - name: Rust
      description: |-
          I have not done a lot with Rust yet, but it is a language that seems very promising.
                  I used it in a small personal project where I created a parser and a lexer.
      level: 2
    - name: Go
      description:
          I have not done a lot with Go yet. I fiddled with gioui.org as it seemed
          promising (cross-platform development).
      level: 1
    - name: Python
      description: |-
          Python is quite familiar. Having studied Computational Linguistics, Python is the choice for Natural Language Processing
                  and Machine learning.
      level: 4
    - name: C++
      description: |-
          When I was 12, I wanted to make Pokemon games. I then decided to learn C and C++. For quite some years, it was my main
                  programming language.
      level: 3
    - name: Unity
      description:
          I have always loved the idea of making video games, but unfortunately,
          I do not have the time to make one myself.

    - name: Neo4j
      description: |-
          I love databases, especially Graph Databases. Neo4j is a Graph Database with a huge community and powerful tools.
                  Its performances make it possible for the app Frend to suggest new users they could get along with. I also used it in Natural Language Processing.
